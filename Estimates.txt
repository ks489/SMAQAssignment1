1. A registration facility for users and home-owners.

2. Home owners should be able to upload details and pictures of their property onto a central database.

3. The central database should keep track of when a property is available (i.e. when users book a
property, the availability dates should be updated accordingly).

4. Whilst browsing, users should be able to keep track of their favourites (stored locally).

5. Once a user has decided upon a property, the website should prompt them to ask them for the
dates they require (ensuring that only valid dates are entered). It should also ask them to write a
short message introducing themselves to the owner.

6. Once this has been submitted, the owner should be notied and, upon their logging in, should be
presented with a pop-up message displaying the details of the request made by the user. They
should then either conrm or reject the user's request.

7. The system should also maintain a ratings-system, whereby home owners and users are given a
rating. This rating is updated after the stay is complete { the user rates the home owner and vice
versa.

8. The system should be reasonably reliable. A degree of down-time is tolerable, but only very
occasionally.

9. The system should be capable of dealing with a reasonably high load of users.

10. As a start-up, it is important that the source code should be reasonably exible; new requirements
are bound to be frequently added.
